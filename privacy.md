# FASTA Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 2025_

FASTA is a lightweight web app that helps you record your path and color it by speed.

## Location
- FASTA uses your device’s **location only while the app is open and tracking**.
- Location data is processed **locally on your device** to draw your path.
- We **do not send or store** your location data on any server.
- You can export your own data (CSV, GPX, or map image) if you choose.

## Storage
- FASTA may use your browser’s **local storage and cache** to:
  - Remember your settings (color palette, keep-awake toggle, etc.).
  - Cache map tiles you’ve already viewed for offline use.
- This information stays **on your device**. It is never shared.

## Connectivity
- FASTA requires an internet connection to fetch new map tiles (unless they are cached).
- The app can function offline for areas you have already viewed.

## Analytics / Ads
- FASTA does **not** include analytics, tracking, or advertising.

## Contact
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the [FASTA GitHub repository](https://github.com/aagoodman/FASTA).
